Según el \"Análisis de Exportaciones Chilenas 2025\", los servicios de Tecnologías de la Información y Comunicación (TICs) lideran con un valor FOB de US$ 909 millones y un crecimiento del 2,7%. Otros sectores destacados incluyen los servicios financieros, con un crecimiento del 4,4%, y los servicios de administración, que crecieron un 3,5% (Fuente: Análisis de Exportaciones Chilenas 2025).\n",

Esto implica que sectores como la investigación y desarrollo, la asesoría, y los servicios logísticos también presentan oportunidades significativas para la exportación (Fuente: Guía para la Exportación de Servicios).\n",
